weapons:

- axe
  -

- orb
  - homer (your orb is attracted to nearby enemies)
  - juggler (you gain additional orbs)

- mines
  - butterfingers (you drop mines 1.5x as quickly)

- magic circle
  - standing in the circle heals you
  - the circle gains a gravitational effect, pulling enemies in

- arrow
  - your arrow pierces up to <x> enemies

spawning:

- have a target # of enemies on screen?
- hints:
  - red x for enemies
  - blue ? for events
  - yellow ! for boons
- spawn from just beyond edges (only for following enemies, not guarding)
- scale with level or scale with time?
  - level makes sense, because then you can get better/faster and the game doesn't get easier
- levels are probably too complex, but there can still be waves
- waves
  - set # of enemies
  - small pause between waves
